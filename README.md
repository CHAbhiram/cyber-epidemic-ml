# Cyber Epidemic ML

A Flask web application that applies *Machine Learning models* to defend against epidemic-style cybersecurity threats such as *XSS attacks, SQL Injection, and Malicious URLs*.

---

## Features

- üõ°Ô∏è **XSS Detection** ‚Äî Uses a deep learning model (`xss_model.h5`)  
- üîç **SQL Injection Detection** ‚Äî Uses trained ML model (`saved_model.pkl`)  
- üåê **Malicious URL Detection** ‚Äî Uses ensemble model (`BestModel_ExtraTreesClassifier.joblib`)  
- üìä Web interface for uploading URLs and queries  
- ‚ö° Real-time results directly in your browser

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHAbhiram/cyber-epidemic-ml.git
   cd cyber-epidemic-ml/project
````

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Running the Application

Start the Flask server with:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the app runs on:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Open this link in your browser.

---

## Usage

1. Navigate to the homepage.
2. Select the **section/module** you want:

   * **XSS Detection** ‚Üí Paste a query or payload to test
   * **SQL Injection Detection** ‚Üí Enter a query to check for injection
   * **URL Threat Detection** ‚Üí Upload or paste URLs for classification
3. Submit your input.
4. View results in the browser (classified as safe/threat).

---

## Example Workflow

* Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

* Select *URL Threat Detection*

* Paste:

  ```
  http://malicious-example.com/abc?id=1
  ```

* Output:

  ```
  Prediction: Malicious URL
  ```

## Troubleshooting

* *Model not found* ‚Üí Ensure the `models/` folder contains required `.h5`, `.pkl`, `.joblib` files.
* *Dependency errors* ‚Üí Reinstall with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* *Port conflicts* ‚Üí Run with a different port:

  ```bash
  flask run --port 8080
  ```
